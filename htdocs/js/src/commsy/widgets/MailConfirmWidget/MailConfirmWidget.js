		 * \brief	Main customization method

		 * By far, the most important method to keep in mind when creating your own widgets is the postCreate method.
		 * This is fired after all properties of a widget are defined, and the document fragment representing the widget
		 * is createdâ€”but before the fragment itself is added to the main document.
		 * The reason why this method is so important is because it is the main place where you, the developer,
		 * get a chance to perform any last-minute modifications before the widget is presented to the user,
		 * including setting any kind of custom attributes, and so on. When developing a custom widget,
		 * most (if not all) of your customization will occur here.
