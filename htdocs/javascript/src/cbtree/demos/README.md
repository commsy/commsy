This directory contains a set of demos of the Dijit CheckBox Tree (cbTree).
All instances of the tree are created programmatically. For examples on how
to create the tree using markup please refer to the /tests directory.

* tree00.html - Basic CheckBox Tree using an in memory JSON object to create the store.
* tree01.html - Demostrate the checkboxes and the tree styling API
* tree02.html - Custom Icons at different indent level using the tree 'icon' property.
* tree03.html - Demostrate the Tree Model API features.
* tree04.html - Use third party widget instead of the cbtree Multi State CheckBox
* tree05.html - Use ToggleButton widget instead of the cbtree Multi State CheckBox

***NOTE:*** The following three examples require PHP support on your server. In addition, tree12.html
requires DOJOX to be installed.

* tree11.html - CheckBox Tree using the cbtree File Store and Fancy Icons.
